# Kerberos Constrained Delegation

### User Account <a href="#user-account" id="user-account"></a>

#### Prerequisites <a href="#prerequisites" id="prerequisites"></a>

Hunting for user accounts that have kerberos-constrained delegation enabled:

```bash
Get-NetUser -TrustedToAuth
```

In the below screenshot, the user `spot` is allowed to delegate or in other words, impersonate any user and authenticate to a file system service (CIFS) on a domain controller DC01.

User has to have an attribute `TRUSTED_TO_AUTH_FOR_DELEGATION` in order for it to be able to authenticate to the remote service.

> TRUSTED\_TO\_AUTH\_FOR\_DELEGATION - (Windows 2000/Windows Server 2003) The account is enabled for delegation. This is a security-sensitive setting. Accounts that have this option enabled should be tightly controlled. This setting lets a service that runs under the account assume a client's identity and authenticate as that user to other remote servers on the network.
